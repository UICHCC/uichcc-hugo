When HCC Computer Club was established, we decided to make HCC a platform for UIC students to share their technical knowledge.

Hackers, or computer enthusiasts, are born to be free, and thus we make HCC an open society without all the red tapes like what other societies do -- no one forces anyone to share anything. Every student can share, and (literally) everyone can join and learn. Knowledge has been free, and it should be free (as in freedom).

This has been the idea behind HCC Tech Salon, a fully student-led technical talk. If you're reading this article, then we bet you must have your own understandings about a few technologies. Don't you want to share your interesting ideas to people who _understand_ you?

Now, we'd like to invite you to stand out and share something you like. It can be anything related to information technology, given that it's appropriate for everyone to know. It doesn't need to be well-prepared; it could be your hobby project or your experience on some technologies.

It might look difficult if you haven't tried to stand on a stage before. Our advice is: just give it a try. [Do it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)
