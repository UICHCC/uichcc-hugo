  - heading: Open Source Community
    image_path: /images/osc.svg
    body: Open counts. We firmly believe that, without open source software and copyleft works, technology today would not be so developed; there would not be our club too. Hence, we decide to share all our work, alongwith the spirit of open source and creative common, to all of our teachers and students, as well as the society.

  - heading: L10n Group
    image_path: /images/l10n.svg
    body: L10n stands for localization. To push on the use of open source software, it is important to make them first available in people's mother tongue. L10n is also the easiest way to contribute to Free and Open Source Software (F/OSS)—you don't even need to know how to code! You are more than welcomed to join us!

  - heading: IT Course Counseling

We sincerely hope that no one will fail this course, because IT is the future, and you are too.
